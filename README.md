# String Rotation Program

## Description

This Go program rotates a given string by a specified number of positions. It takes an input string and a key, and it shifts the characters in the string accordingly.

In the example provided, the string `"abcdef"` is rotated by `2` positions, resulting in the output `"cdefab"`.

## How It Works

- The program defines an input string (`s_input`) and a rotation key (`key`).
- It calculates the effective key by taking `key % len(s_input)`.
- The program then concatenates characters from the input string, starting from the index specified by the key and wrapping around to the beginning of the string.

## Example

For the input:

```go
s_input := "abcdef"
key := 2
Output:
cdefab

How to Run
Make sure you have Go installed on your system.

Save the code in a file named Reverse_a_string.go.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.

Run the program with the command:
go run Reverse_a_string.go
